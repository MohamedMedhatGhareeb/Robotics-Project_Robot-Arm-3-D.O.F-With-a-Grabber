**-Designing a suitable capable Robot to withstand the Torques and Momentums.

Procedure for getting models of robot kinematics that are appropriate for robot control design. The procedure consists of the following steps: 
    1-  derivation of robot kinematic models and establishing correctness of their structures
    2- experimental estimation of the model parameters
    3- model validation **
    
    
**-Applying Forward Kinematics And Inverse Kinematics to control a Robot arm positioning. 

Using an Arduino Mega (2560) as a microcontroller & Serial Connection with **_V-REP_** to simulate the Movement Instantaneously
