# Robotics Project_Robot Arm 3-D.O.F With a Gribber
**-Designing a suitable capable Robot to withstand the Torques and Momentums.**

Procedure for getting models of robot kinematics that are appropriate for robot control design. The procedure consists of the following steps:

    1-  derivation of robot kinematic models and establishing correctness of their structures.
    2- experimental estimation of the model parameters.
    3- model validation.
    
    
**-Applying Forward Kinematics And Inverse Kinematics to control a Robot arm positioning.** 

Using an **_Arduino Mega (2560)_** as a microcontroller & Serial Connection with **_V-REP_** to simulate the Movement Instantaneously 


**-Items Used:**
 
    1- Arduino Mega (2560) & cable.
    2- USB Host Sheild.
    3- 2x Servo SG90 (1.2 Kg/cm).
    4- 2x Servo FS5103B (3.2 Kg/cm).
    5- 2 Voltage Regulator L7805C.
    6- a 12V DC Adapter.
    7- Wires (Jumpers).
    8- USB cable And A PS4 Controller.
